# Assignment

Reproduce (debugging as needed) the live lecture task of setting up and inserting the RPG data into a PostgreSQL database. We walked through most of these steps in lesson but see if you can finish moving the charactercreator_character table.

Next, set up a new table for the Titanic data (titanic.csv) - spend some time thinking about the schema to make sure it is appropriate for the columns. Enumerated types may be useful. Once it is set up, write a insert_titanic.py script that uses psycopg2 to connect to and upload the data from the csv. Then add the file to your repo. Fianlly, start writing PostgreSQL queries to explore the data!

Please upload the insert_titanic.py python file to Canvas.
